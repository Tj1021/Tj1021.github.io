                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Developed communication skills and a determined work ethic through working with fellow employees to create quality products for the company. 
                This was achieved through ensuring the product was running smoothly at all times, keeping an organized work space, and staying in constant 
                communication with my boss to keep the proper products running. The experience I received from my time at Davlyn made me appreciate the value of working hard, as well
                as the ability to have success in a fast-paced environment.
