                <td style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Worked with a high school computer science student learning C in order to help him complete projects for his class. This experience provided
                a chance for me to both grow as a leader, as well as gain a deeper understanding of programming through helping to teach programming concepts.

                <td style="font-style: italic;">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I am currently serving as a percussion instructor for the Owen J. Roberts Middle School Marching Band. I graduated from the Owen J. Roberts
                School District in 2017, and asked my former band director to come back and help grow the program that I went through. This experience has allowed me to grow leadership skills
                such as planning, time management, and effective communication. In the two marching band seasons I have spent helping the percussionists, the students have become more prepared for 
                the High School, and have a better understanding of the fundamentals of marching percussion. Through my work with the band, I have gained valuable experience and grown as a leader and a community member.
