            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p style = "line-height: 1.5;">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I am a fourth year Computer Science student at West Chester University, and I am also a member of the Honors College at WCU. I started programming in high school, 
            and since then programming has become a passion of mine. I am currently searching for an opportunity to start my career in Software Development. 
            Throughout my coursework in West Chester, as well as through personal projects, I have gained experience in a multitude of programming languages and styles of programming. 
            I have experience in Object-Oriented Programming (Java, Python), Imperative Programming (C), Functional Programming (Haskell), and Web Development (HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL).
            Through the Honors College, I have learned valuable leadership and interpersonal skills, gained project management experience, and have become a more well-rounded individual through community service.
